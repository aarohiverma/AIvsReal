# AI vs. Real Images Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify images as either AI-generated or real. Using a dataset of 2000 images, we train a deep learning model to distinguish between authentic and synthetic images, helping to improve deepfake detection techniques.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
- Dataset handling for AI-generated and real images

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib for visualization


## Results
The model is evaluated on multiple metrics to ensure robust classification performance. The results and analysis are provided in the `results/` folder.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model with additional datasets
- Experimenting with transformer-based architectures
- Deploying as a web-based application
